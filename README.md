## Installation

This program was developed with python 3.8.6. It should work on other versions, but reliability is guaranteed on python 3.8.6.

Some modules will need to be installed for this program to work. Run each command once to install the required modules.

```
pip install tk
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

Open the program by double-clicking on “Math Calculator.pyw”. If that does not work, launch “Math Calculator.py”. pyw launches the program without the terminal shell, while py does.

To perform an area calculation, click on Rectangle, Square or Circle buttons respectively.

To close all windows and quit the program, click quit on the home menu, or click the x button in the top corner of the main window.

## Capabilities

This program has been properly tested to work with whole measurements, 1 to 20. However, this program is fully capable of completing calculations of numbers higher than 20, and can properly calculate the areas of decimal numbers.

## Debug

Debug information can be accessed through the console by opening the debug version of the software found in the corrosponding folder, or by changing the extension from .pyw into .py.
